## Reflection
 
  - This was my mod-3 personal project. It just so happened that I had planned a trip to Southern California to job search and surf in between mods. I'm a big surfer and surf forecasting sites are notoriously inaccurate and so I wanted to make my own.
  - I set out to build a data visualization heavy app that would pull in surf forecast data from various sources and consequently visualize that data in a meaningful way.
  - This was a super challenging project. I think I ended up hitting 25 end points and so formatting all the incoming data and visualizing it all was quite difficult. I used FireBase as a backend and ran into some difficulty learning how to use their o Auth system. Also, testing this project was complicated.
  - This project utilizes webpack, react, react router, redux, firebase, ES6, and chart.js.
